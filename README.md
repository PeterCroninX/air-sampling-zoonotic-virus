# Air Sampling Captures Zoonotic Viral Diversity in Live-Bird Markets

## Overview
This repository contains the code and data used for the study:

**"Air sampling accurately captures circulating zoonotic viral diversity emerging from poultry live-animal markets"**

The study investigates the utility of metagenomics applied to environmental samples (e.g., air, cage swabs, carcass wash water) in live-bird markets (LBMs) for detecting zoonotic viruses. This approach is compared with traditional poultry swab sampling techniques.

The findings demonstrate that environmental sampling is a highly sensitive and efficient method for early detection of zoonotic pathogens such as highly pathogenic Influenza A/H5N1 and other avian viruses, enhancing pandemic preparedness strategies.

## Key Findings

- Environmental sampling outperformed traditional poultry swabs in detecting highly pathogenic Influenza A/H5N1 and over 40 additional viruses from major pathogen families.
- Viral contigs from environmental samples showed high similarity to those from poultry swabs, confirming accuracy.
- Environmental metagenomics offers broader coverage, enhanced sensitivity, and lower biosafety risks, making it a robust tool for zoonotic pathogen surveillance.

## Data Sources
- Environmental samples (air, cage swabs, carcass wash water) and poultry swabs collected from live-bird markets in Cambodia.
- Viral nucleic acids sequenced using a capture probe-based metagenomics approach.
